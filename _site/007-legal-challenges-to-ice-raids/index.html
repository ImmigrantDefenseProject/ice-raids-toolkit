The poster is available in multiple languages at <a href="http://www.immdefense.org/ice-arrests">http://www.immdefense.org/ice-arrests</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Videotaping: Many people have asked whether they can or should videotape an ICE raid. There are no states in which it is against the law to film law enforcement while they are engaged in their public duties. However, because of the variety of laws and court cases regarding recording audio and video in different states, it is important to consider several things before videotaping an arrest in the home or in public.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="important-considerations-before-videotaping-an-arrest-in-the-home-or-in-public">Important considerations before videotaping an arrest in the home or in public:</h3> <ul> <li> <p>ICE agents are armed law enforcement officials who are first and foremost concerned for their own safety. Before taking out a recording device, it is best to assess the situation and determine whether taking a video could escalate the situation and endanger anyone present.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is extremely important that if you choose to record, you must make it obvious that you are recording. Almost every state has laws against “secret” recordings. Do not cover up, hide or conceal your camera/phone.</p> </li> <li> <p>Your right to record law enforcement usually comes with the qualification that you must not “interfere” as they are carrying out their “duties.” This means you should stand several feet away from any law enforcement action taking place if you choose to record.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="tell-someone">Tell someone.</h3> <p>Contact local organizations to report a raid.</p> <p>For raids in New York State, contact IDP at 212-725-6422.

The following legal tools to challenge raids may be available:</p> <h4 id="challenging-deportability-in-immigration-court">Challenging Deportability in Immigration Court:</h4> <ul> <li>Move to Suppress Evidence of Alienage or Challenge the Reliability of Evidence: Although options for challenging the use of illegally obtained evidence are more limited in the immigration context than in criminal courts, immigration judges can suppress evidence of deportability based on unlawful conduct by ICE. To pursue deportation against someone DHS charges as undocumented, DHS must first establish in immigration court that the person is foreign-born. Where DHS’ only evidence of “alienage” (where a person was born) was obtained through unlawful conduct, individuals may argue that this evidence should be suppressed and excluded because of violations of the Fourth Amendment’s protections against unlawful search and seizure 45 or the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. A similar argument is available to challenge the reliability of evidence obtained through unlawful conduct. Unlawful conduct can include coercive tactics, force, illegal ruses, or racial profiling.</li> </ul> <p>Many federal court decisions have upheld the suppression of illegally obtained evidence in immigration court proceedings. 46 When the only evidence of alienage is suppressed, removal proceedings must be terminated because DHS has not proven, as required, that the subject of the proceeding is not a U.S. citizen.47 In the case of documented immigrants (e.g. lawful permanent residents, asylees, and refugees), or immigrants who were known to immigration authorities prior to a raid, for example through a visa or work authorization application or a prior encounter with ICE, suppression challenges can face more obstacles but are worth discussing with a lawyer.</p> <ul> <li>Move to Terminate Removal Proceedings Based on Violations of the Governing Regulations or the Constitution. Federal regulations require ICE agents to refrain from unlawful conduct during enforcement operations. 48 Where ICE agents violate individual rights during a raid or other arrest, an individual in removal proceedings can move to terminate those proceedings based on the agents’ conduct that violates the regulations or the Fourth or Fifth Amendments.49</li> </ul> <h4 id="in-federal-court">In Federal Court:</h4> <ul> <li> <p>File Suit for Monetary Damages Under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA): The FTCA, 26 U.S.C. §§ 2671 et seq., permits individuals harmed by federal agencies to sue the United States for monetary damages. Before filing suit, a form setting out the type of damage suffered, the date of the injury, the amount of money sought, and other details must be filed with the federal agency. That form is available here: <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/download/116418">https://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/download/116418</a>. If the federal agency does not respond within six months, or if you disagree with the way they respond, you can file a complaint in federal court, specifying the specific tort laws in your state that were violated, for example, “trespass,” “negligent infliction of emotional distress,” or “property damage.” The statute of limitations for FTCA claims depends on the statute of limitations for each specific “tort” in your state, but is typically two years depending on the state. You do not have to be a U.S. citizen or have lawful status to file these claims. You can also file these claims as a witness to a raid, if you have suffered emotional, physical, property, or other damage. Organizations may also bring FTCA claims.</p> </li> <li> <p>File Suit for Constitutional Violations by Federal Officers and Agents: When agents or officers violate the Constitution — for example, by using excessive force during a raid, or by racial profiling to make an arrest — they can be sued individually in Bivens claims. 50 Bivens claims allow victims of unconstitutional conduct by agents operating “under color of law” (meaning those who act in their official capacity) to file suit in federal court, seeking monetary damages for violations of constitutional law. In some cases where it is shown to be a pattern of unconstitutional behavior, suits can be brought to stop the illegal conduct or stop future illegal conduct. Suits can be brought not only against those who personally conducted the raids, but also against their supervisors and high-level officials who ordered or otherwise guided the conduct. You do not have to be a U.S. citizen or have lawful status to file these claims. Organizations may also, in some cases, bring constitutional claims.</p> </li> <li> <p>File Suit for Constitutional Violations by State and Local Authorities: Where state or local police and other enforcement agencies collaborate with federal immigration authorities to violate the Constitution, they too can be sued for damages under 42 U.S.C. §1983. In addition, the law enforcement agency itself — for example, the local police department or state highway authority — can be sued for monetary damages or to stop the illegal conduct. Individual state officers can also be sued under state tort laws. You do not have to be a U.S. citizen or have lawful status to file these claims. Organizations may also, in some cases, bring constitutional claims.</p> </li> </ul> <h4 id="within-dhs">Within DHS:</h4> <ul> <li>Complain to DHS’ Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL): DHS, through its CRCL office, has a complaint mechanism for individuals alleging misconduct by federal agents and officers. Complaint forms can be found here: <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/file-civil-rights-complaint">https://www.dhs.gov/file-civil-rights-complaint</a>. If investigations are done fully, those who complain must provide sworn statements in interviews with the federal agency.</li> </ul> <p>While complaints must be investigated, they are very rarely substantiated, and there is no possibility of obtaining damages, injunctive relief or remedies from deportation. We recommend that all those who participate in sworn interviews be accompanied by an attorney.</p> <p>44 For example, the Fourth Amendment protects against search, seizure and arrest without probable cause, and does not permit police or agents to enter homes without judicial warrants or consent. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments protect against discrimination because of race, national origin, or gender (though not immigration status). In addition, federal law permits people to file damages claims to federal agencies if you have suffered a “tort,” like property damage, physical battery, or emotional distress.</p> <p>45 See INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032 (1984).</p> <p>46 See, e.g., Sicajau-Cotzojay v. Holder, 725 F. 3d 172 (2nd Cir. 2013); Oliva-Ramos v. Attorney General, 694 F. 3d. 259 (3rd Cir. 2013); Pretzantzin v. Holder, 725 F. 3d 161 (2nd Cir. 2013); Orhorhaghe v. INS, 38 F. 3d 488 (9th Cir. 1994).</p> <p>47 Note that individual assessments on whether to pursue motions to suppress should be made on each case. Individuals who may have a form of relief against deportation available to them, such as cancellation of removal or asylum, may want to move forward on those applications rather than seek to suppress evidence.</p> <p>48 E.g., 8 C.F.R. 287.8(c)(2)(vii) (prohibiting use of coercion during arrest and interrogation by immigration officer); 8 CFR 287.8(a)(1)(ii) (permitting the use of non-deadly force only when an officer has “reasonable grounds” to believe that such force is necessary).</p> <p>49 See Rajah v. Mukasey, 544 F.3d 427, 431, 443, 446 (2d Cir. 2008).</p> <p>50 See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971).</p> <br> <nav class="pagination"> <a href="http://localhost:4000/006-ice-arrest-tactics/" class="pagination_pager" title="ICE Arrest Tactics ">previous</a> <a href="http://localhost:4000/008-emergency-preparedness-for-those-at-risk-of-deportation/" class="pagination_pager" title="Emergency Preparedness for Those at Risk of Deportation ">next</a> </nav> </div> </div> </body> </html>
