We began to monitor home raids in the New York City area in 2013, while we were also tracking ICE detainer practices in our ongoing advocacy to end the City’s entanglement with ICE through a series of detainer policies.11</p> <p>Shortly after the founding of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in 2003, the agency developed a ten-year strategic plan to meet its goals under the “War on Terror.” Entitled “Endgame: Office of Detention and Removal Strategic Plan 2003-2012”,12 its stated mission was: “a 100% rate of removal for all removable aliens … to allow ICE to provide the level of immigration enforcement necessary to keep America secure.” 13 The National Fugitive Operations Program (NFOP)—the division of ICE primarily tasked with home raids—continued to grow and evolve as a critical component of the DHS strategic plan.</p> <p>Under the guise of “national security,” the government has continued to shift its named “priority” immigrant targets — as a response to changing political priorities — but without providing evidence as to how mass punish-ment and deportation provide such security. The G.W. Bush administration initially targeted people from countries with large Muslim populations and people crossing the southern border as the primary threats.14 In doing so, it built up the apparatus for large-scale raids of immigrants at work and at home, as well as for increased collaboration with local law enforcement. The Obama administration furthered the focus on immigrants with con-victions as its primary target — both materially and rhetorically — while simultaneously accelerating the criminalization of immigration-related offenses at unprecedented levels.15 Employing seemingly neutral labels — such as “criminal,” “illegal,” or “felon” — the government’s drive to massively deport immigrants has not only been facilitated by the legacy of the War on Crime but has also led to a precipitous acceleration of racialized policing, mass imprisonment, surveillance, and excessive punishment.</p> <p>The government’s expansive and uncritical use of home raids to arrest immi-grants for deportation not only legitimates the highly problematic use of SWAT teams,16 but also justifies the continual expansion of the federal policing system, as well as the reach of local police. The DHS impact on the militarization of local policing is profound:17 it includes the establishment of massive surv-eillance and data sharing networks; joint training and joint task forces with local police; the use of local police as a “force multiplier” for immigration policing; and the transfer of billions of dollars of military equipment.</p> <p>The fight against home raids is not solely to protect people from deportation. It is also about challenging the normalization of an ever-expanding police state in the name of “homeland security.”</p> <hr /> <p>7 Rosenblum, Marc.
