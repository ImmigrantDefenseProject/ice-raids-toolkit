Bush and Obama administrations, which are laid out below, as well as what we anticipate under the new administration.</p> <h3 id="what-were-the-hallmark-raids-under-gw-bush">What were the hallmark raids under G.W. Bush?</h3> <p>From DHS’ inception in 2003 under the G.W. Bush administration, the government rapidly expanded the National Fugitive Operations Program (NFOP), the ICE program founded a year earlier, to conduct home raids with the purpose of arresting “fugitive aliens.” 34 The Fugitive Operations Teams (FOTs) were trained to use aggressive tactics similar to SWAT teams and mainly conducted two types of raids:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Home Raids:</strong> ICE conducted home raids on a mass scale, claiming that these raids were important mechanisms to apprehend “fugitives” and “criminals,” often labeling them “gang operations” or criminal “cross-check” operations. DHS heavily relied on a SWAT-like approach, where groups of armed officers appeared at residences early in the morning or late at night searching for people.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Workplace Raids:</strong> Although workplace raids had been a feature of immigration enforcement for decades, many of the ICE workplace raids under President G.W. Bush were large-scale and also resulted in federal criminal charges for use of false documents such as social security cards or other identity information. Workers arrested in large factory round-ups with little access to legal counsel, limited proficiency in the English language and/or no familiarity with the judicial system suddenly faced significant time in federal prison before being deported.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="what-tactics-did-ice-use-under-president-gw-bush">What tactics did ICE use under President G.W. Bush?</h3> <h4 id="collateral-arrests-and-quotas">Collateral arrests and quotas</h4> <p>Most of the arrests in the home and in the workplace, were of “collaterals”— individuals at risk of deportation who happened to be present when ICE burst into an address looking for a purported target. Collateral arrests became a standard feature of ICE operations, which increasingly met their arrest quotas 35 by making mass collateral arrests. The new quota requirements corresponded with increased reports of racial profiling of non-target individuals.</p> <h4 id="coercion">Coercion</h4> <p>ICE used coercive tactics specifically to enter homes without proper warrants and without proper consent. Teams of half a dozen agents or more would surround a home in the pre-dawn hours, with guns visible or drawn prior to knocking loudly on doors and windows to urge residents to open the door. The agents did not have proper judicial warrants and needed permission from residents to enter. If a resident merely opened the door, ICE agents would then enter and sweep through the home, often characterizing the fact of the opened door as evidence of consent to enter. Agents usually caused significant property damage due to the forceful and violent nature of these operations. Throughout the G.W. Bush-era, individuals challenged these tactics in federal courts and a number of judges found the conduct unconstitutional for lack of proper consent to enter or search. 36</p> <h4 id="threats-and-force">Threats and force</h4> <p>ICE agents during home raids frequently used force, for example, drawing weapons; grabbing, hitting and pulling residents; damaging doors, windows and other property; and threatening to residents to obtain entry or to conduct searches without warrants. When individuals challenged this behavior in federal courts, some judges deemed this kind of conduct an “egregious” violation of the Fourth Amendment. 37</p> <h4 id="deception">Deception</h4> <p>Under President G.W. Bush, ICE agents routinely used a range of deceptive tactics, known as ruses, to enter homes or workplaces. In 2005 and 2006, for the first time, ICE issued two memoranda setting guidelines for ICE agents’ use of deception. 38 The memos explicitly prohibited ruses that involved health and safety programs (e.g. pretending that they were workers checking on a gas leak) or agents identifying themselves as representatives of “another agency (federal, state or local) or that of a private entity” without prior permission. In practice, however, officers regularly raided homes by identifying themselves as “police,” asserted they were looking for an individual other than the purported target, pretended to be investigating a crime such as identity theft, and even claiming an emergency inside that required their entry. Once inside, ICE agents would arrest anyone in the home at risk of deportation.</p> <h4 id="local-law-enforcement-collaboration">Local law enforcement collaboration</h4> <p>ICE regularly collaborated with local police, probation officers, and parole officers to investigate targets. In addition, in many cases ICE was accompanied on operations by local law enforcement agents, giving them the ability to announce that they were “police” rather than ICE agents when seeking entry and increasing the number of law enforcement present.</p> <h4 id="use-of-local-law-enforcement-databases-to-label-those-targeted-or-arrested-as-gang-members-or-associates">Use of local law enforcement databases to label those targeted or arrested as gang members or associates</h4> <p>ICE made frequent use of local law enforcement databases to identify targets as gang members or associates, regardless of whether such individuals had ever been arrested, charged, or convicted of any crime. In some cases, ICE agents labeled individuals as gang associates simply by virtue of having been arrested during a gang operation or living in a home where a gang member was thought to have lived at one time.</p> <h3 id="what-tactics-has-ice-used-under-president-obama">What tactics has ICE used under President Obama?</h3> <p>Under President Obama, DHS continued to use surveillance, force and deception to rip unsuspecting people out of their communities for removal proceedings. After successful legal challenges to the G.W. Bush-era approaches, DHS shifted gears and promoted its work as “targeted enforcement,” minimizing its use of sweeping raids. The Obama era nonetheless will have been marked by the continuation of abusive ICE practices that undermine the fabric of communities and raise policy concerns. Below are common tactics ICE agents have used, as reported to IDP in hundreds of stories over the past three years. To read individual reports of these tactics, see Appendix B.</p> <h3 id="under-obama-when-attempting-to-arrest-people-in-the-community-ice-agents-generally">Under Obama, when attempting to arrest people in the community, ICE agents generally:</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Work in teams</p> </li> <li> <p>Arrive early in the morning to homes (e.g. between 5am and 8am)</p> </li> <li> <p>Have only an “administrative” warrant 39 signed by a supervisor at ICE rather than a judge</p> </li> <li> <p>Must get consent from a resident to look for someone in a home because the agents usually do not have a warrant signed by a judge authorizing entry</p> </li> <li> <p>Use surveillance and database research to locate and detain people in public spaces outside of the home</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="under-obama-common-ice-arrest-tactics-include">Under Obama, common ICE arrest tactics include:</h3> <h4 id="physical-force">Physical force</h4> <p>40 Although the frequency appears to have decreased, the Obama administration did not abandon the violent tactics employed during G.W. Bush-era raids. At homes, ICE agents have pushed past people who have merely opened the door and sometimes forced open closed or locked doors— in one case, to arrest someone who no longer lived at the address. Agents have stormed into homes without identifying themselves and sometimes drawing their guns immediately, including in front of children.</p> <h4 id="threats">Threats</h4> <p>Community members reported ICE threatening them with the use of force—particularly those asking to see a warrant before allowing entry. Agents warned that, if they had to go and get a warrant, they would return and destroy the place or rip the house apart. ICE agents have also threatened to knock down a door, search a home without consent, or to have someone arrested for harboring an “illegal alien” if the person at the door did not assist them in locating their target.</p> <h4 id="intimidation">Intimidation</h4> <p>In addition to flat-out threats, ICE has used the public nature of raids to pressure people into allowing entry to minimize embarrassment, parking multiple DHS cars prominently outside of a home and banging and yelling loudly at the door. ICE agents have also waited for long periods outside of a home or visited a residence multiple times, essentially harassing and stalking fearful residents until they help ICE locate the targeted person.</p> <h4 id="deception-1">Deception</h4> <p>Under President Obama, ICE agents without judicial warrants increasingly began to enter homes through deception, also known as “ruses.” Agents trick residents into believing the officers are local police investigating criminal matters, even announcing themselves as “police.” Residents—not knowing the agents’ true purpose—often then help ICE locate a loved one for deportation by letting ICE into the home or helping the officers arrange a meeting with the person ICE eventually detains. ICE agents have also used similar lies to call targeted people and lure them to specific public locations, even going so far as to arrange meetings at NYPD precincts only to detain the person outside. Pretending to be local police, ICE agents:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Request help with a criminal investigation</p> <ul> <li> <p>Ask residents to review photographs/mugshots of criminal suspects</p> </li> <li> <p>Use a stranger’s photograph but the targeted person’s name when describing a criminal suspect, prompting residents to locate loved ones to correct the error</p> </li> <li> <p>Claim someone is using a person’s name to commit crimes and request to speak to the person to clear this up</p> </li> <li> <p>Say that a criminal suspect or fugitive has been using that address or is in the vicinity and thus officers need to enter and search to ensure the person is not present</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Claim that the targeted person has been the victim of identity theft or fraud and they are investigating</p> </li> <li> <p>Call a targeted person to clear up an accusation and arrange a meeting</p> <ul> <li> <p>Describe the person’s vehicle and claim they need to meet to inspect it, as it is reported to have been in an accident</p> </li> <li> <p>Claim they need to inspect the individual’s body for signs of injury, as s/he is suspected of having been in a fight reported to police</p> </li> <li> <p>Claim they need to see proof of compliance with a prior court case</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h4 id="surveillance">Surveillance</h4> <p>Under President Obama, ICE has used significant resources to research, identify, and track the locations of removable people agents intend to arrest in the community.41 They have used information from the criminal legal system to arrest people who are not incarcerated at their court dates as well as at probation/parole. They have used information from federal and local databases and immigration applications to identify home addresses. They also have used physical surveillance to follow and detain people in various public spaces, including outside of homes, shelters or workplaces —  even arresting a woman in front of her child’s pre-school where she had just dropped him off. These agents typically presented themselves immediately as ICE officers and quickly detained the individual.</p> <h4 id="targeted-arrests-using-tactics-that-instilled-fear-in-witnesses">Targeted arrests using tactics that instilled fear in witnesses</h4> <p>Under President Obama, ICE reduced its use of collateral arrests. This has meant that, for the most part, when ICE agents showed up at homes, workplaces or in public spaces, they located and detained the target only. Despite this, during some home raids, ICE has requested identification, photographed identity documents and taken fingerprints from people who were not the target. Although the witnesses generally were not detained in the moment, these tactics put many people in fear of deportation. Moreover, it was unclear how or if the information collected by ICE would be used in the future. In a few cases reported to IDP from New Orleans, LA, ICE agents did review identity documents or fingerprints and immediately detain other individuals present who were not initially targeted.</p> <h3 id="what-we-may-see-under-the-trump-administration">What we may see under the Trump administration</h3> <ul> <li> <p>An increase in the number of raids and agents conducting arrests in communities</p> </li> <li> <p>A return to more sweeping raids with collateral arrests (i.e., people who were not the initial target but nonetheless at risk of deportation)</p> </li> <li> <p>Continued if not expanded use of force</p> </li> <li> <p>Continued use of ruses with evolving prompts</p> </li> <li> <p>More pressure on employers &amp; others to turn people over to ICE</p> </li> <li> <p>More joint task force operations between local police and ICE (e.g. gang task forces) 42</p> </li> </ul> <hr /> <p>34 In 1995, the government created “alien abscondee teams,” but they were not prioritized until the founding of DHS.

In September of that same year, ICE issued a memorandum instructing agents that the 1000-arrest goal could include anyone encountered in an operation, even if they were not initially a target. See Memo from John Torres, “Fugitive Operations Case Priority and Annual Goals,” Jan. 31, 2006 and Memo from John Torres, “Fugitive Case Management System Reporting and the 1000 Arrests Annual Goal for Fugitive Operations Teams,” Sept. 29, 2006, available at <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/2009/20090205_RAID_FINAL.pdf">http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/2009/20090205_RAID_FINAL.pdf</a>.</p> <p>In 2010, however, ICE issued a new policy on priorities for enforcement that instructed agents to direct resources primarily toward “aliens who pose a risk to national security or a risk to public safety”; “recent illegal entrants,” and “aliens who are fugitives or otherwise obstruct immigration controls.” See Memo from John Morton, “Civil Immigration Enforcement: Priorities for the Apprehension, Detention and Removal of Aliens,” June 30, 2010, available at <a href="https://www.ice.gov/doclib/news/releases/2010/civil-enforcement-priorities.pdf">https://www.ice.gov/doclib/news/releases/2010/civil-enforcement-priorities.pdf</a>.</p> <p>36 As part of one of the lawsuit settlements, in Aguilar, et al., v.
