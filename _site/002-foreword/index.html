This was not surprising given that Trump had campaigned extensively on a sensationalist anti-immigrant platform. Though it is hard to predict exactly how the next president will move this hate-based agenda forward, in an early interview, he named individuals he described as “criminal and [those that] have criminal records” as the key first targets.5</p> <p>For social justice advocates everywhere, there is much to be concerned about in the coming months and years. But in order to fully address the challenges ahead of us, we need to take stock of the conditions that make our current moment possible. Today’s attacks on immigrants are the result of an ongoing cycle of expulsion, exclusion, and criminalization of those deemed “unworthy” of belonging. Since the founding of this country, the aggressive policing of immigrants — particularly from the Global South — has been a defining feature of U.S. immigration policy and practice.</p> <p>The deportation of non-citizens with criminal convictions has been a stated focus of the federal government’s since the 1980s.6 Such efforts depend on both an ever-expanding discourse that demonizes immigrants and justifies excessive and perpetual punishment, as well as on tremendous government investment in a massive deportation apparatus. The political climate of the subsequent years helped to realize this focus through various initiatives. These included the passage of harsh laws in 1996 that expanded the criminalization of immigrants and consequently, the government’s power to arrest, imprison and deport non-citizens on a massive scale.</p> <p>Over the past three decades, the federal government has increasingly justified massive investments in its immigrant detention and deportation infrastructure by using the labels “criminal,” “illegal,” or “felon” to more effectively dehumanize, surveil, punish, and exile millions of people. Through harsh laws and policies, the government has significantly expanded who can be defined as a “criminal.” By linking the policing and imprisonment of immigrants to a broadly defined “national security,” the government is able to justify the massive funding allocated to “homeland security.”</p> <p>Procedurally, the founding of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in 2003 required a major restructuring of government agencies and priorities, along with a tremendous diversion of federal spending. For a department tasked with protecting “national security,” the permanent removal of people with criminal convictions has increasingly served as the justification for the funding of the world’s largest policing, imprisonment, and deportation apparatus. A key feature of the growing political convergence of the War on Terror with the War on Immigrants has been the expansion of collaboration efforts between local police and ICE and of the ICE police state — requiring the diversion of hundreds of billions of government dollars — towards the mass policing, imprisonment, and expulsion of immigrants.</p> <p>The creation of the “homeland security state” has involved the normalization of criminalization and deportation. As a result, DHS — its underlying logic, the profound human suffering it has caused, its relationship with other agencies, and the political interests it serves — has not received the kind of public scrutiny an institution of such magnitude and influence deserves. In the past 15 years, the U.S. has deported 5 million people — almost twice as many people than in the previous 110 years combined!</p> <p>Not only have millions of lives been irreparably disrupted, these policies are at odds with the current forward-thinking movement to reduce the harms of over-policing and mass incarceration. The success of this cruel system depends, in part, on the dehumanization of whole social groups, including strategically deploying labels such as “criminal,” “illegal,” or “felon” to shape public attitudes. At the same time, the government has incorporated and exploited the harmful ideologies and tactics of the so-called “War on Crime” and “War on Drugs” to escalate the racialized policing, mass imprisonment, surveillance, and excessive punishment of immigrants and other socially marginalized groups. The lines between the criminal legal system and immigration system have become dangerously thin.</p> <p>It is no accident that ICE guides and trains its officers to use techniques that further militarize the policing of communities of color. Much like other law enforcement agencies with documented discriminatory outcomes, ICE policies and strategies encourage and justify overly-aggressive policing tactics, widespread surveillance, and a disregard for constitutional and human rights. ICE’s unchecked zeal to target, arrest, and deport immigrants with convictions not only destroys families and communities, but also reinforces the inequalities of the criminal legal system upon which many of its policies rest.</p> <p>Yet despite the enormity of this system, it is not without its weaknesses. A system that creates so much human pain, erodes fundamental fairness and human rights, and threatens the safety of millions in the name of “security” is, at its source, unsustainable. With every iteration and expansion over the years, growing numbers of communities in every part of the country have organized to reject its dehumanization, curb its growth, and uphold dignity and justice. The next “version” should expect increased resistance. If we can revisit key learnings, adjust our approach, and expand our toolbox accordingly, we can better support each other as well as the leadership of communities on the frontlines.</p> <hr /> <p>5: Schultheis, Emily,”President-elect Trump says how many immigrants he’ll deport,” CBS News, Nov 13, 2016, available at <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/president-elect-trump-says-how-many-immigrants-hell-deport/">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/president-elect-trump-says-how-many-immigrants-hell-deport/</a></p> <p>6: Kandel, William A. “Interior Immigration Enforcement: Criminal Alien Programs,” Congressional Research Service, Sept. 8, 2016, available at <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/R44627.pdf">https://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/R44627.pdf</a></p> <br> <nav class="pagination"> <a href="http://localhost:4000/001-purpose-of-toolkit/" class="pagination_pager" title="Purpose of Toolkit ">previous</a> <a href="http://localhost:4000/003-acronyms/" class="pagination_pager" title="Acronyms and Abbreviations ">next</a> </nav> </div> </div> </body> </html>
