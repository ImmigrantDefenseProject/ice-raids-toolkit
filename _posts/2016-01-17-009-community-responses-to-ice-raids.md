title:  "Community Responses to ICE Raids"
chapter: 9
---

People and organizations have been steadfastly fighting back against ICEâ€™s practice of criminalizing immigrants and arresting people in their communities. Our approach is to continue reevaluating tactics and strategies to  identify key leverage points and expand our toolbox accordingly. The ultimate goal is to maximize our ability to take care of each other, prevent abuses, and support the leadership of frontline communities for long-term change.

We will continue to update and prioritize effective tactics as we learn more about the practices on the ground during the Trump administration. Visit: [http://www.immdefense.org/ice-arrests](http://www.immdefense.org/ice-arrests) to learn more about community responses to ICE raids and detention and deportation overall:

* Policy initiatives

* Know Your Rights materials and trainings

* Organizing community defense strategies

* Building a case campaign

* Seeking support from elected officials
