### Where does ICE conduct arrests?

For years, ICE has arrested people for deportation in the following locations:

**Jails:** The most common way for ICE to locate and arrest non-citizens is from local jails.28 Because of database sharing programs, ICE receives notice of arrests when a non-citizen is fingerprinted. If that individual is in criminal custody and deemed a priority for deportation, ICE sends the jail a "detainer" request for voluntary transfer of the person to ICE or notification of release timing so ICE can then detain the person. Some local law enforcement cooperate with these requests; others place limits on it or have refused cooperation.

**Homes:**  ICE agents commonly arrest non-citizens directly outside of or inside of their homes. This includes supportive housing residences, apartment buildings, and homeless shelters. Sometimes ICE agents linger around the neighborhood, surveilling the home and blocks surrounding
it for the target.

**Courthouses:** ICE agents regularly come to criminal courthouses to arrest non-citizens who are targets, meaning they have been identified as "criminal aliens" or as a priority for enforcement, regardless of the charges they are facing in their open cases. Agents are usually dressed in street clothes and wait in the court hallways. Sometimes the agents wait inside the courtroom and have already alerted the court clerk or the District Attorney of their intentions to make an arrest. ICE often detains people regardless of whether they have appeared before the judge on their open case.

**Probation/Parole:** Non-citizens who are on probation or parole are a common target for ICE enforcement. Individuals who are on probation or parole are regularly turned over to ICE. Commonly, ICE agents arrest people at a regular check-in. Sometimes a probation/parole officer calls people to schedule a new check-in during which ICE arrests the person. Note: At the time of publication, the New York City Department of Probation has a policy that limits their cooperation with ICE.29  Barring certain narrow exceptions, they do not turn people over to ICE in most cases. This does not include individuals who are on Federal probation in NYC. If you hear of an ICE arrest at a NYC probation office, please contact IDP.

**Checkpoints:** Both Customs and Borders Protection (CBP) and ICE agents have the ability to detain and arrest individuals who they have a reasonable suspicion are not in the U.S. lawfully. CBP can do this within 100 miles of the borders and ICE agents can do this throughout the rest of the U.S. Agents usually set up car checkpoints, stopping certain cars and asking individuals for proof of their legal status where there is reasonable suspicion that they are not lawfully in the U.S. If they cannot offer proof of lawful status, officers arrest them. In some jurisdictions, local law enforcement turn over non-citizens to ICE through separate police checkpoint activity.

### Are there places where ICE is not supposed to conduct arrests?

Since October 2011, ICE has had a policy prohibiting enforcement activities (arrest, interview, search, or surveillance of non-citizens) at the following "sensitive locations," barring extraordinary circumstances:

* schools (includes pre-school through colleges/universities
and vocational or trade school)

* hospitals

* churches, synagogues, mosques or other institutions of worship

* the site of a funeral, wedding, or other public religious ceremony

* a site during a public demonstration, such as a march,
rally or parade

The policy, which may be subject to change under the next administration, can be found here: [https://www.ice.gov/doclib/ero-outreach/pdf/10029.2-policy.pdf](https://www.ice.gov/doclib/ero-outreach/pdf/10029.2-policy.pdf)

### How does ICE identify and locate people at risk of deportation?

ICE regularly identifies people at risk of deportation in the following ways:

* **Data sharing with police:**

    * **At street encounter:** Police routinely conduct warrant checks. One of the databases they check is the FBI’s National Crime Information Center (NCIC), a centralized database of crime-related data including records on people who are wanted by law enforcement. ICE adds information into this database, including people who have been ordered deported in the past.

    * **At time of criminal arrest:** Through fingerprint sharing programs run by the FBI, DHS has access to information that is entered at the time of arrest and can compare it to their own database. If ICE is interested in deporting that person, they will either ask the police to notify ICE when the person is being released from criminal custody, or to detain the person for ICE to come pick them up. 30

* **Data sharing with state agencies:**

    * **DMV:** ICE uses the "National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System" (Nlets) to obtain certain information provided in driver’s license applications and subsequent driver history (e.g., accidents and traffic offenses). If ICE is interested in particular individuals, it can use this information to locate them.31

    * **State criminal records:** ICE regularly contacts Criminal Court clerks to get copies of non-citizens’ criminal records (in NY, the RAP sheet), criminal complaint, and Certificates of Disposition or final judgement from the criminal case.

    * **State registries:** ICE appears to access information placed on state registries, including order of protection and sex offender registries, particularly those fed into national databases like NCIC. Under Operation Predator, ICE tracks who is on the sex offender registries and targets them for enforcement activities.

* **International travel:** Non-citizens with lawful immigration status (e.g. green card holders, asylees, students) who travel internationally go through Customs when they return to the U.S. They are fingerprinted upon re-entry, triggering a criminal record review. Sometimes they are also interviewed by CBP agents about their criminal history. This is a common way for ICE to locate non-citizens with criminal convictions.

* **Immigration applications:** All applications submitted to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) require the biometrics (fingerprinting and eye scanning) of applicants. USCIS uses the information to run a search of databases 32 to determine if the applicant is eligible for the benefit they are seeking and/or whether they are removable.
